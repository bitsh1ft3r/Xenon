condition is expected to be persistent the operation need not be retried by host software.
Persistent communications errors may arise from faulty interconnect with the device, from
a device that has been removed or has failed, or a number of other causes.

* E Internal error: The host bus adapter experienced an internal error that caused the
operation to fail and may have put the host bus adapter into an error state. Host software
should reset the interface before re-trying the operation. If the condition persists, the host
bus adapter may suffer from a design issue rendering it incompatible with the attached
device.

interface through a retry operation or other recovery action. This may arise from a noise
burst in the transmission, a voltage supply variation, or from other causes. No action is
required by host software since the operation ultimately succeeded, however, host
software may elect to track such recovered errors in order to gauge overall
communications integrity and potentially step down the negotiated communication speed.

temporarily lost but was re-established. This may arise from a device temporarily being
removed, from a temporary loss of Phy synchronization, or from other causes and may
be derived from the PHYRDYn signal between the Phy and Link layers. No action is

software may elect to track such recovered errors in order to gauge overall
communications integrity and potentially step down the negotiated communication speed.

error since the last time this bit was cleared to zero.

state since the last time this bit was cleared to zero.

* H Handshake error: When set to one, this bit indicates that one or more R_ERRP
handshake response was received in response to frame transmission. Such errors may
be the result of a CRC error detected by the recipient, a disparity or 10b/8b decoding
error, or other error condition leading to a negative handshake on a transmitted frame.

* S Link Sequence Error: When set to one, this bit indicates that one or more Link state
machine error conditions was encountered since the last time this bit was cleared to zero.

erroneous transition.

detected by the Phy since the last time this bit was cleared to zero.
