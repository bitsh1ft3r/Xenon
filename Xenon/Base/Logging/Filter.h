     * A filter string consists of a space-separated list of filter rules, each of the format
     * `<class>:<level>`. `<class>` is a log class name, with subclasses separated using periods.
     * `*` is allowed as a class name and will reset all filters to the specified level. `<level>`
     * a severity level name which will be set as the minimum logging level of the matched classes.
     * Rules are applied left to right, with each rule overriding previous ones in the sequence.
     *
     * A few examples of filter rules:
     *  - `*:Info` -- Resets the level of all classes to Info.
     *  - `Service:Info` -- Sets the level of Service to Info.
     *  - `Service.FS:Trace` -- Sets the level of the Service.FS class to Trace.
